# Markdown Editor

This is a web-based, mobile-friendly, full-featured editor for Markdown. Created as a personal tool, it is now available for everyone.

## How to use

If you're just looking for an editor, you can use the public version, hosted on [markdowneditor.quentinpugeat.fr](https://markdowneditor.quentinpugeat.fr).

If you are a developer, you can clone this repo and build the app with the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli). You'll need to install Node.js first, then Angular CLI. Then, run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
